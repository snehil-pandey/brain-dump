# 🔢 Matrix - Gauss Elimination
*A small script born from college assignments and pure survival instinct.*

This tool performs **row operations**, **GCD-based elimination**, and prints clean, formatted matrices for step-by-step solutions.  
Ideal for solving Linear Algebra problems like Gauss Elimination, Echelon Form, and assignment nightmares.

## 🚀 Features  
- Takes custom matrix size (rows × columns)  
- Accepts full matrix input  
- Prints matrix with proper spacing  
- Performs row operations using GCD  
- Shows every step like a textbook solution  
- Produces a clean final **Echelon Form**

## 📂 Why This Exists (The Origin Story)  
Because college assignments don’t wait…  
and doing matrix elimination by hand at 1 AM is not character development — it's torture.  

This script was created to:  
- Avoid silly manual calculation mistakes  
- Speed up solving matrix problems  
- Save time during assignment deadlines  
- Understand elimination steps more clearly  
- Reduce mental breakdowns during mid-sems

## 🎁 Benefits  
- **Fast**: Eliminates matrices in seconds  
- **Accurate**: No row-operation errors  
- **Educational**: Shows each transformation  
- **Reusable**: Works for any size matrix  
- **Readable output**: Clean and spaced formatting

## 📝 How to Use  
Run it directly with Python:

```bash
python matrix_elimination.py
````

Follow the prompts:

1. Enter number of rows
2. Enter number of columns
3. Enter each row space-separated
4. Watch the step-by-step elimination happen

## ⚙️ Notes

* Uses GCD-based scaled row elimination (reduces fractions nicely)
* Designed for clarity, not speed optimization
* Perfect for Linear Algebra assignments or practice
