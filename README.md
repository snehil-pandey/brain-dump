# 🧪 Snehil’s Chaos Lab  
Where random ideas become random scripts.

This repo holds all the small things I build on impulse —  
from math hacks to weird experiments I swear made sense at the time.

## 🧠 What’s Inside?
- Code I wrote half awake  
- Scripts solving problems nobody asked for  
- Math utilities I needed once and never again  
- Experiments that accidentally work (sometimes)

## 🎯 Purpose  
To store every “Wait, let me try something…” moment.

## ⚠️ Warning  
Contents may include:
- Unnecessary brilliance  
- Necessary stupidity  
- Overengineered solutions for underwhelming problems  

Use at your own amusement.
